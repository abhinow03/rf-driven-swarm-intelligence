"""Single source of truth for the defense demo's model-swap seam.

Every demo script (scripts/demo_act1_contrast.py, demo_act2_pipeline.py,
demo_act3_live.py, run_demo.py) imports ACTIVE_ADAPTER from here instead of
hardcoding an adapter path. Swapping the demo's "current production LLM"
from v5-a to v5a2 (once v5a2 passes its preregistered bars, see
docs/PREREGISTRATION_V5A2.md) is a one-line edit to ACTIVE_ADAPTER below --
nothing else in the demo code may name a "v5_sft*" path directly.

ACTIVE_ADAPTER_TRAIN_FILE travels WITH ACTIVE_ADAPTER: pipeline_v2.py's
Layer-3 prior correction (_rescore_and_correct -> scoped_correct) uses the
active adapter's OWN training-file class frequency (the same per-adapter-
frequency convention pipeline_v2.default_class_freq() uses for v3b-fix) --
if you change ACTIVE_ADAPTER you must change ACTIVE_ADAPTER_TRAIN_FILE too,
or the prior correction will be scored against the wrong distribution.
