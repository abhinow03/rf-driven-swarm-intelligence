"""
Synthetic swarm-trajectory generation, dataset assembly, and splitting.

Consolidates the data-generation code that was duplicated across the three
notebooks. Two correctness fixes versus the originals:

1. A single seeded ``np.random.Generator`` is threaded through ALL sampling
   (velocity, direction, dispersed offsets, noise). The originals seeded only
   the outer loop, so datasets were not actually reproducible.
2. Train/val/test normalisation uses TRAIN statistics only, applied to all
   splits (the original computed per-split stats — harmless on i.i.d. synthetic
   data, but wrong in principle and a bug if data ever stops being i.i.d.).

NOTE: ``generate_transition_sequence`` is reconstructed from the documented
behaviour in the notebook (cosine-ramp blend between two formations). Diff it
against the original notebook on first run if exact parity matters.

# Canonical home for LEAD_IN_RANGE/BLEND_DURATION_RANGE/MIN_DWELL_RANGE: this module, not
# eval_trajectories.py, now that both the training path (generate_dataset, via the
# corrected_blend_timing/windowed_examples flags below) and the evaluation path want them.
# eval_trajectories.py imports these FROM here rather than duplicating them, closing off
# the exact silent-drift risk the V5 program's step-26 audit found once already (a Monte
# Carlo diagnostic script whose own hardcoded copy of these ranges went stale).
WINDOW_SIZE = 50            # matches Config.max_seq_len -- PositionalEncoding's buffer is
                             # sized to this; every existing checkpoint assumes it exactly.
STRIDE = 10                 # matches sliding_window_inference's default stride.

BLEND_DURATION_RANGE = (10, 25)   # timesteps the blend itself spans
MIN_DWELL_RANGE = (40, 60)        # timesteps of settled formation_b after the blend ends

# Window-labeling thresholds (docs/V5_LOG.md step 31 has the full derivation):
#
# PURE_LABEL_THRESHOLD = 0.70 (35/50): a window is labeled a PURE endpoint formation only
# if that formation's per-timestep true content is a COMFORTABLE majority, not a bare one.
# Reuses the exact same 35/50 figure already derived for MIN_DWELL_RANGE/LEAD_IN_RANGE
# (docs/V5_LOG.md steps 24-26: a window needs >=26/50 timesteps of one formation for an
# outright majority; +9 stride-slack margin gives real headroom above that minimum, 35/50 =
# 0.70). Reusing it here is not laziness: it means "a window eval's OWN observability logic
# would trust as reliably showing formation A" and "a window training confidently labels
# pure-A" are THE SAME window, by construction -- train and eval agree on what "confidently
# observed" means, not just on blend timing.
#
# TRANS_LABEL_MIN_BLEND_FRAC = 0.20 (10/50): "transitioning" as a label CANNOT use the same
# 0.70 bar -- BLEND_DURATION_RANGE's own max (25 timesteps) is exactly half of WINDOW_SIZE,
# so blend content can never reach even a bare majority (>=26/50) of any window, let alone
# 70%. Requiring 0.70 for "transitioning" would make the label unreachable under the
# corrected timing and silently delete the class from ported training data. Instead: a
# window is "transitioning" if blend content is the PLURALITY of its three content types
# (beats both pure_a and pure_b individually) AND is at least as large as the shortest
# possible full blend region can produce (BLEND_DURATION_RANGE's own minimum, 10/50 = 0.20)
# -- below that floor, the window is grazing a blend edge without containing a meaningful
# chunk of it, and belongs in the EXCLUDE band, not the transitioning class.
