"""
Bucket classification (AUDIT.md sec AE): is a swarm observation something a
plain (from, to) -> RULES dict lookup can resolve on its own (A, RESOLVABLE),
something a dict COULD answer but shouldn't be trusted to without a hedge (B,
GUARDABLE), or something no 2-tuple lookup can ever answer regardless of
confidence (C, UNRESOLVABLE)? This is the coverage question behind "why not
just ship the dict" -- pipeline_v2.py routes A to RULES directly, B to a
machine-generated abstention, and C to the fine-tuned LLM layer.

Two input shapes, two entry points, same bucket vocabulary:

  classify_observation(predictions) -- REAL swarm_intent.stgt.inference.
    sliding_window_inference() output (rich per-window dicts, including
    class_probabilities). Built on stgt_bridge.bridge_predictions(), which
    already does the OOV-sentinel / oscillation-preserving / dispersed-
    converging-ambiguity work this module needs -- reused, not reimplemented.
    This is the path used to MEASURE real-world coverage (measure_coverage.py).

  classify_ctx(ctx, key_windows) -- the templated tactical-context TEXT
    representation used by TEST_CASES (build_sft_dataset.synth_context) and
    the degradation/holdout batteries, which have no real per-window
    class_probabilities (synth_context never simulates one) -- the dispersed/
    converging ambiguity guard structurally can never fire on this path,
    disclosed, not a bug. Reuses the same (from, to) extraction regex
    llm_finetuning/baselines.py's composite router already keys its own
    routing decision on, so pipeline_v2's bucket boundary is directly
    comparable to what the existing composite already does. This is the path
    used to EVALUATE pipeline_v2 against the existing 55-case/degradation
    batteries, which carry no real STGT inference output at all.
