"""
Integration shim: converts the vendored, read-only teammate's STGT
(``stgt/inference.py::sliding_window_inference``) prediction list into OUR
tactical context (``context_spec`` vocabulary + ``calibration`` thresholds) --
NOT upstream's ``build_tactical_context``/``build_llm_prompt`` (see
``stgt/README.md`` for why those weren't vendored).

Four correctness issues this module exists to fix (AUDIT.md sec V, step 4):

1. ``predict_v2``'s ``transition_from``/``transition_to`` fields are the
   classifier's top-2 probability RANKS for a single window (only populated
   when that window's OWN predicted class is "transitioning"), not a temporal
   "what did the swarm change from/to over time" signal. This module NEVER
   reads those two fields -- transitions are derived purely from consecutive
   ``formation_type`` values across the window sequence, exactly like this
   repo's own ``inference.py::build_tactical_context`` already does for its
   ``transitions_detected`` list (that part was already correct; the bug this
   guards against is a hypothetical future caller keying ``RULES``
   (``llm_finetuning/build_sft_dataset.py``) on the per-window fields instead).

2. Upstream's ``build_tactical_context`` (not vendored) dedupes formation
   history with ``dict.fromkeys``, which collapses ANY repeated value anywhere
   in the sequence, not just consecutive runs -- an oscillation like
   ``dispersed -> encirclement -> dispersed`` collapses to
   ``dispersed -> encirclement``, silently erasing the return trip. This
   module collapses only consecutive repeats (``itertools.groupby``), which
   preserves oscillation while still not spamming one entry per window.

3. ``RULES`` (``build_sft_dataset.py``) is keyed EXCLUSIVELY on
   ``BASE_FORMATIONS x BASE_FORMATIONS`` (49 entries) -- it has no entry for
   the classifier's own "transitioning" class, nor for any other string. A
   window whose ``formation_type`` isn't a member of ``BASE_FORMATIONS`` is
   therefore un-lookupable and must not silently flow into the transition /
   dominant-formation computation as if it were a real geometry. Such windows
   are replaced with the sentinel ``"unknown"`` (matching
   ``OUTPUT_SCHEMA``'s own ``likely_intent: ... / unknown`` abstention word),
   excluded from transition/dominant-formation logic, and if EVERY window in
   the batch is unknown the whole context abstains (``summary["abstain"] =
   True``) rather than fabricating a confident-looking narrative from nothing.

4. ``dispersed`` and ``converging`` share IDENTICAL base geometry in
   ``data_gen.py`` (same ``rng.uniform`` branch) -- when their classifier
   probabilities are close, the predicted label is close to a coin flip. This
   matters because ``converging -> encirclement`` is one of the more severe
   ``RULES`` entries; a window flagged ambiguous here is a place a downstream
   assessment should hedge, not escalate confidently on a near-50/50 read.

Also caps ``key_windows`` at a fixed maximum (long streams over many strides
would otherwise grow the prompt unboundedly) and never emits a character
absent from every training prompt (e.g. upstream's own ``build_tactical_context``
emits a literal "warning" glyph the fine-tuned models have never seen).

ROBUST REDUCTION (AUDIT.md sec AG, ``robust=True``, default ``False``): sec AF's
real-STGT-output eval found the UNANIMITY reduction above throws away 240/249
(96.4%) of real sequences whose generator ground truth IS a clean (a,b) pair --
sec AG step 1 diagnosed why: 25.7% end in a trailing "transitioning" run that
breaks unanimity even though every earlier window was clean (a windowing
artefact, sec AF step 4), 22.5% are all-transitioning with no unanimous window
at all, and 46.2% (the largest single cause) are guarded by the dispersed/
converging ambiguity check above -- a real upstream defect, not brittleness,
deliberately NOT touched here. ``robust=True`` fixes the first two causes only:
  a. strip leading/trailing "transitioning" runs before reducing -- a window
     ending mid-transition still has a determinable start formation.
  b. reduce by MAJORITY, not unanimity: the modal NON-transitioning formation
     in the first half and the second half of what's left after (a); if they
     differ and each holds a plurality >= ``robust_threshold`` (of that half's
     FULL length, so a half dominated by noise still fails), that is the
     (a,b) pair.
  c. if every window is transitioning even after (a) (nothing left to split),
     aggregate ``class_probabilities`` across all windows and take the top-2
     non-transitioning classes; if well separated (margin >=
     ``ALL_UNKNOWN_FALLBACK_MARGIN``), treat as a resolvable steady state,
     flagged low-confidence.
  d. the dispersed/converging ambiguity guard is UNCONDITIONAL -- it still
     applies to a robustly-recovered pair exactly as it does to a unanimous
     one, per this module's docstring point 4. Sec AG step 2's own dev-set
     tuning found this guard alone still blocks 92/96 (95.8%) of otherwise-
     robustly-recovered cases -- reported honestly, not hidden, in AUDIT.md.
``robust_threshold`` defaults to 0.7, chosen by sweeping {0.45..1.00} on a
SEPARATE dev split (seed=1, never the seed=0 eval set) and picking the lowest
threshold at the sweep's precision ceiling (49.0% -- no threshold reached the
stated 90% floor; see ``llm_finetuning/tune_robust_reduction_threshold.py``
and AUDIT.md sec AG for the full, unflattering result).
